  <Recipe Name="Rusty Nail" 
          Description="A Rusty Nail is made by mixing Drambuie and Scotch whisky. A Rusty Nail can be served in an old-fashioned glass on the rocks, neat, or `up` in a stemmed glass. It is most commonly served over ice.  The drink was included in Difford's Guide's Top 100 Cocktails. "
          History="According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the Rusty Nail took a while to find its proper place in the world.  
          The combination of Drambuie—`the world's most distinguished Scotch-based liqueur`—and the whisky it is made from first appears 
          in 1937 in the form of the B.I.F., credited to one F. Benniman and ostensibly named after the British Industries Fair. 
          Wondrich goes on to note that `it took another generation or so for the drink to assume its classic name and form, during 
          which time it tried on several identities. 
          The cocktail authority Dale DeGroff notes, `the Rusty Nail is often credited to the clever bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan sometime in the early 1960s.`
          The cocktail's name was finally cemented in 1963, when Gina MacKinnon, the chairwoman of the Drambuie Liqueur Company, gave the Rusty Nail her endorsement 
          in The New York Times. DeGroff observes that in the early 1960s `the Rat Pack was enamored of the drink, which may have been responsible for
           the wide appeal in those years."
